# Introduction to React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables developers to create reusable UI components.

Here's a simple example of a functional React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Welcome to React!</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

This component renders a simple heading. To use it, import and include it in your application.
